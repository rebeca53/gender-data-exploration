# gender-data-exploration
This is a project to practice data visualization skills as part of the Master in Geospatial Technologies

Check the notebook with the cell outputs at: https://nbviewer.org/github/rebeca53/gender-data-exploration/blob/main/Gender_Financial_Inclusion_in_Latin_America_%28Mexico_and_Brazil%29_Notebook.ipynb

## Plus
I also trained machine learning models to predict individual income in Brazil. Ensemble learners achieve higher accuracy. However, simple learners like LASSO have better interpretability in understanding and ranking the variables that influence income. You can check the results in this [presentation](https://github.com/rebeca53/gender-data-exploration/blob/main/Income%20Prediction%20on%20Brazil%20data%20(1).pdf).
